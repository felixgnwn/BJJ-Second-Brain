1. Side Control is safer than half guard
2. Always prevent the cross face to avoid your opponent to flatten you out (Use the image, where your elbow is almost like underhooking their arm to prevent the cross face)

3. In that position, you want your leg (knee shield leg) to be as close to their hip as possible to prevent the mount (As shown in the image)

4. When doing the octopus, you dont want to shrimp out, but you want your hips as close as to their as possible (Breaking the rule of jiu jitsu where you make space for your legs or knees to recover guard)
5. Another key thing is to always tuck your elbow in (Underneath your body), you never want to straighten your hand / shoulder
6. You want to trap their hip using your leg by being behind their hip

7. The dilemma from the position (As shown in the image). We can either sweep them by grabbing the ankle and bellying down and walking towards that trapped leg. Or if the opponent stand up with their leg, we can just scoop the leg and sweep the other way.

7. Another dilemma when youre doing the ankle and bellying down sweep, if they push against it, you can do an old man roll, where you just trap their hip grip, and do some sort of forward roll, and goes into a bridge position where you can sweep them the other direction (Shown in the image below)

8. To avoid the darce, you dont want your elbow under their body, you want your elbow to be underhooking their arm or outside the body. similar to the first position / image
